## Navigate to folder
Don't forget, you can get the project folder path by dragging that folder into Terminal from Finder!
```
cd path/to/project/folder
```

## Pull latest version
```
git pull
```

## Project setup/install packages
This will only be necessary when there are package changes, which won't be often. If things mysteriously stop working, this is worth a try.
```
npm install
```

### Compile for development (with hot-reloads)
```
npm run serve
```

### Compile and minify for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lint and fix files
```
npm run lint
```
